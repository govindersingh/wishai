# Shopify Theme App Extensions - Getting Started Example

A [theme app extension](https://shopify.dev/apps/online-store/theme-app-extensions) boilerplate that highlights the basic structure and features that are available to developers who want to integrate their apps with Shopify Online Stores. It has been built as a learning tool for the start of your journey of building a theme extension, and is not intended as a starting point for projects.

## Setup

If this is your first time building a theme extension, take a look at the [Getting Started guide](https://shopify.dev/apps/online-store/theme-app-extensions/getting-started).


TL;DR: [Install the Shopify CLI](https://shopify-dev-staging.shopifycloud.com/apps/tools/cli/installation), log into your partner account with `shopify login`, and then create a new theme extension using the `--getting-started` flag:

```
shopify extension create --type=THEME_APP_EXTENSION --getting-started
```
